## What is Adobe Character Animator?

**Adobe Character Animator** is a groundbreaking application that allows artists, animators, and performers to bring digital characters to life in real time using motion capture technology. By leveraging a standard webcam and microphone, the software translates human facial expressions, body movements, and vocal input into animated performances‚Äîwithout the need for complex keyframing or manual animation. This makes it an incredibly powerful tool for live broadcasting, educational content, digital storytelling, and interactive experiences.

The software is deeply integrated with Adobe Creative Cloud, enabling users to design characters in Photoshop or Illustrator and animate them immediately in Character Animator. Its intuitive system includes features like automatic lip-syncing, face tracking, gesture triggers, and a wide range of customizable behaviors. It is trusted by professional animators, streamers, educators, and digital marketers worldwide for its ability to produce high-quality animated content quickly and efficiently.
